# RoboCards
A modular robotics kit for kids that teaches coding through physical NFC code cards. Kids build programs like puzzles, scan them with an Arduino-based pen, and watch a real robot execute their logic. Includes guided challenges and a web-based control interface.

# How It Works
Children arrange physical NFC cards, each representing a specific command or logic block, to create a program. They then scan this sequence of cards with an Arduino-based "pen." The pen reads the commands and sends them to a robot, which immediately executes the program.

# Key Features
Tangible Coding: Learn programming concepts by physically arranging NFC code cards.
Instant Feedback: Watch a real robot execute your code moments after scanning it.
Arduino-Based Scanner: An easy-to-use pen for reading the NFC cards and transmitting the program.
Guided Challenges: A set of structured activities to guide learning from basic to more advanced concepts.
Web Interface: An alternative web-based portal for controlling the robot and exploring its capabilities.
